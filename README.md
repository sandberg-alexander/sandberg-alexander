  # Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  ### MSc Cybernetics and Robotics student at NTNU, Trondheim

My name is Alexander and I am currently doing my masters in cybernetics and robotics at NTNU, Trondheim. My main profile is autonomous systems and I am currently writing my project thesis on development and implementaion of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods capable of generating causal explanations for the actions of a Reinforcment Learning (RL) agent. The following master thesis will likely build upon implementing the methods on real cyber-physical systems.
